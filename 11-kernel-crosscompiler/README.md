*Concepts you may want to Google beforehand: cross-compiler*

**Goal: Create a development environment to build your kernel**

If you're using a Mac, you will need to do this process right away. Otherwise, it could have waited
for a few more lessons. Anyway, you will need a cross-compiler once we jump to developing in a higher
language, that is, C. [Read why](http://wiki.osdev.org/Why_do_I_need_a_Cross_Compiler%3F)

I'll be adapting the instructions [at the OSDev wiki](http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler). 


Required packages
-----------------

First, install the required packages. On linux, use your package distribution. On a Mac, [install brew](http://brew.sh/) if
you didn't do it on lesson 00, and get those packages with `brew install`

- gmp
- mpfr
- libmpc
- gcc
- wget

Yes, we will need `gcc` to build our cross-compiled `gcc`, especially on a Mac where gcc has been deprecated for `clang`

Once installed, find where your packaged gcc is (remember, not clang) and export it. For example:

```
export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9
export LD=/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9
```

We will need to build binutils and a cross-compiled gcc, and we will put them into `/usr/local/i386elfgcc`, so
let's export some paths now. Feel free to change them to your liking.

```
export PREFIX="/usr/local/i386elfgcc"
export TARGET=i386-elf
export PATH="$PREFIX/bin:$PATH"
```

binutils
--------

Remember: always be careful before pasting walls of text from the internet. I recommend copying line by line.

```sh
mkdir /tmp/src
cd /tmp/src
curl -O http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.24.tar.gz # If the link 404's, look for a more recent version
tar xf binutils-2.24.tar.gz
mkdir binutils-build
cd binutils-build
../binutils-2.24/configure --target=$TARGET --enable-interwork --enable-multilib --disable-nls --disable-werror --prefix=$PREFIX 2>&1 | tee configure.log
make all install 2>&1 | tee make.log
```

gcc
---
```sh
cd /tmp/src
curl -O https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-12.2.0/gcc-12.2.0.tar.gz
tar xf gcc-4.9.1.tar.bz2
mkdir gcc-build
cd gcc-build
../gcc-12.2.0/contrib/download_prerequisites
../gcc-12.2.0/configure --target=$TARGET --prefix="$PREFIX" --disable-nls --disable-libssp --enable-languages=c --without-headers
make all-gcc 
make all-target-libgcc 
make install-gcc 
make install-target-libgcc 
```

That's it! You should have all the GNU binutils and the compiler at `/usr/local/i386elfgcc/bin`, prefixed by `i386-elf-` to avoid
collisions with your system's compiler and binutils.

You may want to add the `$PATH` to your `.bashrc`. From now on, on this tutorial, we will explicitly use the prefixes when using
the cross-compiled gcc.
