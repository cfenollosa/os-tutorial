# Bootsector Stack

## Concepts you may want to Google beforehand

### stack

## Goal: Learn how to use the stack

The usage of the stack is important, so we'll write yet another boot sector
with an example.

Remember that the `bp` register stores the base address (i.e. bottom) of the stack,
and `sp` stores the top, and that the stack grows downwards from `bp` (i.e. `sp` gets
decremented)

This lesson is quite straightforward, so jump ahead to the code.

I suggest that you try accessing in-stack memory addresses by yourself,
at different points in the code, and see what happens.
